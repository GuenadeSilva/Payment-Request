This Project is a payment request data set

### Using the starter project

For the first part of the challenge,is to ingest and model the source data 

#### 
    Include document with information around:
    1. Preliminary data exploration
    2. Summary of your model architecture
    3. Lineage graphs
    4. Tips around macros, data validation, and documentation


#### Objective:

For the second part of the challenge, develop a production version of the model for the Data Analyst to utilize. This model should be able to answer these three questions at a minimum:

#### 
    1. What is the acceptance rate over time?
    2. List the countries where the amount of declined transactions went over $25M
    3. Which transactions are missing chargeback data?

In addition to presenting the model, please provide the code (pseudo-code also suffices) for answering these questions. 
Feel free to provide the code, the actual answers, a brief description for the analyst, and any charts or images to help with the explanation.
